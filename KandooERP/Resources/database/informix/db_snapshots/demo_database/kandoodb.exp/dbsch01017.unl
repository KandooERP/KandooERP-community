Column (fix_id) already exists in table.\
\
This statement tries to add the column shown, but one with that name\
already exists. Check the spelling of the name; if it is as you\
intended, then the table is not arranged as you expected it to be. You\
can review the names of all the columns in a table by querying\
syscolumns. Supply a table-name in the following query:\
\
SELECT colname, colno FROM syscolumns C, systables T\
        WHERE C.tabid = T.tabid AND T.tabname = 'table-name'\
\
You can use RENAME COLUMN to change column names.\

The error code (-201) was received.\
\
A syntax error has occurred.\
\
This general error message indicates mistakes in the form of an SQL\
statement. Look for missing or extra punctuation (such as missing or\
extra commas, omission of parentheses around a subquery, and so on),\
keywords misspelled (such as VALEUS for VALUES), keywords misused (such\
as SET in an INSERT statement or INTO in a subquery), keywords out of\
sequence (such as a condition of "value IS NOT" instead of "NOT value\
IS"), or a reserved word used as an identifier.\
\
Database servers that provide full NIST compliance do not reserve any\
words; queries that work with these database servers might fail and\
return error -201 when they are used with earlier versions of Informix\
database servers.\
\
The cause of this error might be an attempt to use round-robin syntax with\

A syntax error has occurred.\
\
This general error message indicates mistakes in the form of an SQL\
statement. Look for missing or extra punctuation (such as missing or\
extra commas, omission of parentheses around a subquery, and so on),\
keywords misspelled (such as VALEUS for VALUES), keywords misused (such\
as SET in an INSERT statement or INTO in a subquery), keywords out of\
sequence (such as a condition of "value IS NOT" instead of "NOT value\
IS"), or a reserved word used as an identifier.\

Database servers that provide full NIST compliance do not reserve any\
words; queries that work with these database servers might fail and\
return error -201 when they are used with earlier versions of Informix\
database servers.\

Referential constraints are not allowed on tables of type raw.\

The CREATE TABLE statement contains constraints that are not allowed for RAW \

\
Check constraint (ck_invoicehead_inv_num) failed.\
\
The check constraint placed on the table column was violated. To see the\
check constraint associated with the column, query the syschecks system\
catalog table. However, you must know the constrid for the check constraint\
before you query syschecks. (The constrid is assigned in the sysconstraints\
system catalog table.) Use the following subquery to show the check\
constraint for constraint-name:\
\
SELECT * FROM syschecks\
        WHERE constrid = (SELECT constrid FROM sysconstraints\
           WHERE constrname = constraint-name)\
\
In certain scenarios, you might get this error without a constraint name being\
specified. This can happen if you are performing a DDL operation that has a\
check constraint that is violated by the existing data on the table.\
In this case, the DDL operation would not succeed, and thus the constraint\
name would not be in the system catalog.\

A syntax error has occurred.\
\
This general error message indicates mistakes in the form of an SQL\
statement. Look for missing or extra punctuation (such as missing or\
extra commas, omission of parentheses around a subquery, and so on),\
keywords misspelled (such as VALEUS for VALUES), keywords misused (such\
as SET in an INSERT statement or INTO in a subquery), keywords out of\
sequence (such as a condition of "value IS NOT" instead of "NOT value\
IS"), or a reserved word used as an identifier.\

Database servers that provide full NIST compliance do not reserve any\
words; queries that work with these database servers might fail and\
return error -201 when they are used with earlier versions of Informix\
database servers.\

The cause of this error might be an attempt to use round-robin syntax with\
CREATE INDEX or ALTER FRAGMENT INIT on an index. You cannot use round-robin\
