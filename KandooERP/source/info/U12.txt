User Setup

Field Account Mask

This provides a facility to limit the access to the General Ledger for a specific user.  
Entering a valid segment structure will act as a default for the transactions entered, 
and restrict access to only those accounts in the General Ledger.  

For example, if the General Ledger structure is 
'XX-XXX-XXXX', 
being branch, division and chart, 

entering a mask of '01-001-????' 

will give the user access only to accounts in 
branch '01', 
division '001'.  

The General Ledger structure and chart of accounts should be set up prior to setting up users.
