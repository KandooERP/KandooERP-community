This is the KandooERP branch which will be a SAP-compatible KandooERP project. All associates should take it as a new development, from scratch. Besides this, the developers have total freedom to write new code.

The way we will go about it is:

Analysis of SAP Business ONe DB Schema.
Business Logic Analysis of individual modules. 
Screens/Menus/Reports etc.

We will define a clear flexible architecture for this development, and then check whether any part of KandooERP can be reused in this project, and adopt them within the framework.

Reports and analytics should be created in BIRT as much as possible.

A set of clear API for integration with third party software will be defined.

The greater the number of KandooERP associates, the sooner we can make this happen. Please note that development would be fast with the aid of efficient code generators in the tools we are using.

Meanwhile please help yourselves with sales and support of the current KandooERP.
